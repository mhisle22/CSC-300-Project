Solo Sprint ReadMe

I have completed parts 2 and 3, and have unfinished code for part 1.
There is full documentation and testing on parts 2 and 3, but none
for 1.

Running the program-
Run the program using Main.java . The program will start with the user login 
window. If there is not alreadya server made, the program will 
create a new one for you. To login to this
server, simple press connect or enter "localhost" then connect. From there,
you can login as the user "admin" with the password "CSC300". This will take
you to the Fiscal Year Selection page (part 3). From here, you can view
whichever group of plans you would like. For ease of use, simply choose the
"All" option, which will show all plans regardless of their quarter. From there
, select any plan to view (Yearly VMOSA Plan is the most thorough). This takes 
you to the main page. From here, you can edit the name and information of the
plan, add statements, and add categories, to name a few. To add a new statement,
right click on an existing one. This will give you a number of options,
one of which is to view comments (this works on both statements and categories).
Note that the "business plan" root statement does not allow comments. To add a
category, simply press the category button on the righthand side. If there
are no categories, you will not be able to add new nodes.

Testing the program-

Both tests are located in the NewTests package of the program. Both will run
automatically. IMPORTANT NOTE: TestFX randomizes the placement of the window
on the screen. For smaller screen computers, this means that the lower 
"Leave comment" button is sometimes unreachable by the robot. To solve this,
simply run the test multiple times until it correctly places the screen. A
way to fix this (sometimes) is raising the console tab at the bottom of
eclipse upwards.

A more in-depth description can be found in the design document.
